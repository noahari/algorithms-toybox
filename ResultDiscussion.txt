Considering the data points I found, it is worth noting that the initial figure, 
while accurtely showing the scale of each algorithm's runtime, fails to show the actual trend
of insertion sort's runtime. In order to show insertion sort alongside the other algorithms despite
its disproportionately high runtime I included a log scale plot as well.

The data points I found generally confirm the values of each algorithm's runtime, 
as is particularly notable with insertion sort whose runtime is linear, resulting
in the significantly higher y-values it has as opposed to the other algorithms 
which are all linearithmic and had very similiar and often approximately the same runtimes.

Furthermore, the plotted trends align with the expected function of their runtimes
against input array size. The randomized quick sort also has, on average, the fastest
runtime of all tested algorithms which aligns with class and industry based expectations.
